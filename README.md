This is a repository for my C++ source codes. You can use them only when you agree that you will not require me to have responsibility for troubles made by them and only when you understand the following cautions:
- I always use "namespace std" because it helps me so well.
- I often do not encapsulate a member variable because I like a function returning a reference to a member rather than a pair of a setter and a getter.
- I define my own STL container classes and my own smart pointers because it is much easier for me to debug source codes without classes which someone elese created than to debug source codes with them.
- I do not obey specific naming-rules because I like to name members in my way.
- I use macros because they are very useful to define packages for debugging and SFINAE.
