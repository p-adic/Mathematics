This is a repository for my C++ source codes. Please be careful about the following:
- I do not obey a recommendation to encapsulate a member variable.
- I do not obey a recommendation to avoid using "namespace std".
- I do not obey a recommendation to follow naming-rules.
- I do not obey a recommendation to avoid using macros.
